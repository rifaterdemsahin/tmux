## Why We Need Tmux to Write Objectives and Key Results

### Introduction
Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. It is a powerful tool for developers and system administrators.

### Benefits of Using Tmux for Writing Objectives and Key Results

1. **Session Management**: Tmux allows you to create, manage, and switch between multiple terminal sessions. This is useful for keeping your work on objectives and key results organized and easily accessible.

2. **Persistence**: Tmux sessions can be detached and reattached, meaning you can start writing your objectives and key results, detach the session, and come back to it later without losing your place.

3. **Efficiency**: With Tmux, you can split your terminal window into multiple panes, allowing you to view and edit multiple documents or sections of your objectives and key results simultaneously.

4. **Remote Work**: Tmux is particularly useful for remote work. You can start a Tmux session on a remote server, detach it, and reattach it from another location, ensuring continuity in your work.

5. **Customization**: Tmux is highly customizable, allowing you to set up your environment exactly how you like it, which can improve your productivity when writing and managing objectives and key results.

### Conclusion
Using Tmux for writing objectives and key results can greatly enhance your productivity and organization. Its session management, persistence, efficiency, remote work capabilities, and customization options make it an invaluable tool for this purpose.
