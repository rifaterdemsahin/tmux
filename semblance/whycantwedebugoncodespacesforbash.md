# Why Can't We Debug on Codespaces for Bash?

## Introduction
This document explores the reasons why debugging Bash scripts on GitHub Codespaces might be challenging and provides potential workarounds.

## Challenges
1. **Lack of Integrated Debugger**: Codespaces does not have a built-in debugger for Bash scripts.
2. **Environment Differences**: The development environment in Codespaces might differ from local environments, leading to inconsistencies.
3. **Limited Tooling**: There are fewer tools available for debugging Bash scripts compared to other languages.

## Workarounds
1. **Using `set -x`**: Add `set -x` at the beginning of your script to enable a trace of commands.
2. **Echo Statements**: Insert `echo` statements to print variable values and track script execution.
3. **VS Code Extensions**: Use extensions like "Bash Debug" to add debugging capabilities.

## Conclusion
While debugging Bash scripts on Codespaces presents challenges, using available tools and techniques can help mitigate these issues.
